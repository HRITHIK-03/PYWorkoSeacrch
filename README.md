# PYWorkoSeacrch

This project encompasses the dynamic intersection of web scraping, database management, web application development, and data analysis. The primary goal is to extract job listings for Python developers from Indeed.com through web scraping techniques, subsequently storing this information in a MongoDB database. The second facet involves the creation of a robust Django admin panel, providing users with the capability to search, edit, and delete job entries seamlessly. Finally, the project concludes with a statistical analysis utilizing NumPy to compute the average salary for Python developers within a specified location. This multifaceted assignment not only evaluates technical proficiency in diverse areas but also emphasizes a holistic understanding of real-world application scenarios.
